Problem: Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-.
Therefore it is not a palindrome.palindrome, and false otherwise.


Program:

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        pal_check = str(x)
        if pal_check == pal_check[::-1]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
